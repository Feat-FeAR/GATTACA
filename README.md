# GATTACA

<b>GATTACA</b> is a short for <b>General Algorithm for The Transcriptional Analysis by one-Channel Arrays</b>.
It consists of a set of R scripts for the analysis of Transportome Transcription in Cancer Datasets.
As the name suggests, GATTACA was originally written with (one-color/high-density) microarray technology in mind, however it can be easily adapted to analyze RNA-Seq data as well.

GATTACA assumes data to be already background-subtracted, log2-transformed, and interarray-normalized.
To this purpose, use the platform-specific <i>*_to_Expression.R</i> script.
