# Options for GATTACA. Change what you need following the descriptions.
# The options have a type annotation beside them, showing the allowed
# types for that option. Using the wrong types will lead to errors.
# More info in the README.


## GENERAL - General options
general:
  # Slowmode: if true, asks for confirmation after every analysis step. 
  slowmode: true # bool
  # Print out small snippets of data before every analysis step?
  show_data_snippets: true # bool
  # Save PNG and/or PDF plots?
  save_pdf: true # bool
  save_png: false # bool
  # Plot width and height in inches.
  plot_width: 6 # int
  plot_height: 3 # int
  # PPI (pixel per inch) value for PNG plots
  png_resolution: 250 # int
  # If true, plots will be enumerated in the order they are created
  enumerate_plots: true # bool
  # If annotation are added, some plots (like volcano plots) are more legible
  # as they use HUGO symbols instead of probe IDs. Specify here one available
  # annotation ID based on your chip. Leave to `null` to not annotate.
  # Available annotations (chip_name -> id):
  # Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Set (A) -> hgu133a
  # Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Set (B) -> hgu133b
  # Affymetrix Human Genome HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Array -> hgu133plus2
  # Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 -> HsAgilentDesign026652
  # Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0-ST Array -> hugene10st
  annotation_chip_id: null # null OR str


## SWITCHES - Various switches to turn parts of the analysis on or off
switches:
  # Run the analysis, but don't save any output file. Useful to test the
  # analysis before committing.
  dryrun: false # bool
  # Should re-run normalization after performing RMA?
  renormalize: false # bool
  # Run Differential gene expression detection with `limma`
  # This uses parametric tests to find DEGs.
  limma: true # bool
  # Run Differential gene expression detection with `rankproduct`
  # This uses non-parametric tests to find DEGs.
  rankproduct: true # bool


# DESIGN - Experimental design
design:
  # Define the experimental design.
  # The experimental design describes which samples are of which group, and if
  # any samples are paired (such as being from the same patient).
  # NOTE :: The groups must NOT contain numbers. Sorry!
  # Read the README for a guide on how to define this.
  experimental_design: "[treated, control]:2" # str
  # Select which experimental group pairs should be analysed. Pass strings of the
  # type "<group1>-<group2>" to see group1 vs group2 (group2 will be the 
  # reference).
  contrasts: ["treated-control"] # list of str
  # Specify if there are any technical replicates in the data. Each sample must
  # be related to a single, unique technical replicate level.
  # This string will be parsed identically to `experimental_design`, so the
  # same shorthands and formatting are allowed.
  # Leave to `NULL` if there are no technical replicates.
  technical_replicates: null # null or string
  # Specify the colours that represent the groups above. Must cover all groups (or more)
  group_colors: [
    "cornflowerblue", "firebrick3", "olivedrab3",
    "darkgoldenrod1", "purple", "magenta3"
    ] # list of str
  # Filters:
  filters:
    # Filter out (mark as non-differentially-expressed) any genes that have lower
    # log2 expression than this value. This value depends a lot on the experiment.
    # The readme has pointers on how to choose the correct value.
    log2_expression: 4 # num
    # Filter out any genes that have lower absolute Fold Change than this value.
    # Usually 0.5 or 1.
    fold_change: 0.5 # num
    # Minimum gene presence per group
    min_groupwise_presence: 0.8
