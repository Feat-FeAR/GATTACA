# Tea
Tea, short for Transportome Enrichment Analysis is a pipeline for processing microarray data to detect general transportome up- or down- regulation.

## Installation
This will(tm) eventually(tm) be on PyPA, but for now install it with:
```
git clone git@github.com:MrHedmad/bioTEA.git
cd bioTEA
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install setuptools build
python -m build
deactivate
pip install ./dist/bioTea-<some_version>-py3-none-any.whl
```
Then call it with `biotea --help`

## Usage
The manual will come, eventually (tm). For a guided usage, try `biotea wizard`.
