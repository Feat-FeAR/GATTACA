# Options for GATTACA. Change what you need following the descriptions.
# The options have a type annotation beside them, showing the allowed
# types for that option. Using the wrong types will lead to errors.
# More info in the README.


## GENERAL - General options
general:
  # Slowmode: if true, asks for confirmation after every analysis step. 
  slowmode: true # bool
  # Print out small snippets of data before every analysis step?
  show_data_snippets: true # bool
  # Define logfile name. Leave null to use default of `gattaca_(time).log`.
  log_name: null # null OR str
  # Save PNG and/or PDF plots?
  save_pdf: true # bool
  save_png: false # bool
  # Plot width and height in pixels
  plot_width: 16 # int
  plot_height: 9 # int
  # ??????
  append_annotation: true # bool


## SWITCHES - Various switches to turn parts of the analysis on or off
switches:
  # Run the analysis, but don't save any output file. Useful to test the
  # analysis before committing.
  dryrun: false # bool
  # Log2 transform the input intensities before running the analysis?
  log2_transform: false # bool
  # Should re-run normalization after performing RMA?
  renormalize: true # bool
  # Options related to the `limma` package
  limma:
    # Run Differential gene expression detection with `limma`
    # This uses parametric tests to find DEGs.
    run_DEA: true # bool
    # The package can run both paired and unpaired differential expression
    # analises. If `true`, run the paired analysis. If `false`, run the unpaired
    # analysis. Note:: Paired analysis can only be run when only one contrast is
    # selected. Check the README if you intend to use this option.
    run_paired_DEA: false # bool
  # Options related to the `rankproduct` package
  rankproduct:
    # Run Differential gene expression detection with `rankproduct`
    # This uses non-parametric tests to find DEGs.
    run_DEA: true # bool
    # The package can run both paired and unpaired differential expression
    # analises. If `true`, run the paired analysis. If `false`, run the unpaired
    # analysis. Note:: Paired analysis can only be run when only one contrast is
    # selected. Check the README if you intend to use this option.
    run_paired_DEA: false # bool


## CHIP - Information about the chips.
chip:
  # Type of the chip. This is used to source annotation data
  # Currently supported chips:
  # -- Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Set (A)
  # -- Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Set (B)
  # -- Affymetrix Human Genome HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Array
  # -- Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0-ST Array
  # -- Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2
  type: null # str
  # Should the tool use remote or local databases?
  # Note: setting this to false makes the `type` option obsolete.
  use_remote: true # bool
  # If a local database is used, where is it stored (absolute paths only)?
  # Read the readme for more info on the expected format of the database file
  local_database_path: null # str path like


# DESIGN - Experimental design
design:
  # Define any experimental groups here.
  # NOTE!! : The FIRST group MUST be the control/background/wild-type!
  experimental_groups: ["Control", "Treated"] # list of str
  # Define the experimental matrix.
  # The experimental matrix describes which samples are of which group, as
  # defined above. Read the README for a guide on how to define this.
  experimental_design: [1, 1, 2, 2] # list of int
  # Specify the colours that represent the groups above. Must cover all groups (or more)
  group_colors: ["cornflowerblue","firebrick3","olivedrab3","darkgoldenrod1","purple","magenta3"] # list of str
  # Select which experimental group pairs should be analised. Group pairs are
  # generated from the group names defined above. Use slowmode if uncertain.
  contrasts: [1] # list of int
  # Filters:
  filters:
    # Filter out (mark as non-differentially-expressed) any genes that have lower
    # log2 expression than this value. This value depends a lot on the experiment.
    # The readme has pointers on how to choose the correct value.
    log2_expression: 4 # num
    # Filter out any genes that have lower absolute Fold Change than this value.
    # Usually 0.5 or 1.
    fold_change: 0.5 # num
    # Minimum gene presence per group
    min_groupwise_presence: 0.8
